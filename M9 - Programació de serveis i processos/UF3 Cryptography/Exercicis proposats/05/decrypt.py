# 05. Create a program in Python language, using the imperative procedural programming paradigm, that decrypts through brute force the following message:
#                                           drobosckczisxpsvdbkdonkwyxqdrovsoedoxkxdc

# For this, the following must be taken into account:
#       ● The original message has been encrypted with Caesar cipher.
#       ● The alphabet used in the original message is the English alphabet.
#       ● The shift is unknown.
#       ● The number of vowels with respect to the total number of letters in the original message exceeds 37.00%.


def decrypt():
    word = "drobosckczisxpsvdbkdonkwyxqdrovsoedoxkxdc"
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    
    # Provar tots els desplaçaments de l'alfabet(26 lletres)
    for shift in range(26):

        descrypted = ''
        vocals = 0
